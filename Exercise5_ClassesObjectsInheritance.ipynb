Each cat breed class should en-*tail* at least 2 attributes, and 2 methods (either overriden or new). The attributes and methods can be simple or complex or silly, as long as they have *some* relation to the descriptions of that breed on PetFinder. The methods can be the same as long as the implementation is specific to that breed. Think about what the cats _do_ (what _methods_ the classes will have) and how that \"behavior\" may affect or be affected by their attribute values. The purpose of this is to reinforce what is an attribute and what is a behavior/method."
