    "Read the rules of your game carefully. On paper or a whiteboard, determine what classes and perhaps subclasses you need to create your game. What values and bahaviors belong to these classes? Think about the game step by step, what is happening and what information is needed? You should have at least a `Dice` class, a `Game` class named after your game, and a `Player` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For guidance, check out [Think Python 18.8 Class Diagrams](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2019.html). It may be strategic to spend **at least half of your time** on this assignment planning before moving on to write the code for these classes.\n",

    "- Your `Player` class should model behaviors of taking a turn and making choices in the game, which can be random, strategic, or some default. You can choose what required or optional arguments your own `Player` class will have as long as they make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write at least one `Player` subclass that determines game choices based on a different strategy than your default player class. Perhaps your player subclass could be an `InteractiveMode` where user input instead of a pre-defined strategy is used to determine whether or not to roll again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your `Game` class should enforce rules of the game, keep score, and facilitate players taking turns. Instanciating a new game should at least require `Player` objects, _who_ will play the game. `Game` must accept 2 players or more. \n",
