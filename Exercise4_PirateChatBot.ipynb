    "**Due October 8 by midnight California time**\n",

    "The goal for this exercise is to learn some new tricks with strings and then develop a Pirate Chat Bot that responds to the user based on a a few simple rules. \n",

    "Below are a bunch of examples of how you might use string methods to parse input and construct responses.\n",

    "*Note on co-development* If you work in teams, please follow the _pair programming model_. That is, whoever is typing does not decide what to type, they're just \"driving.\" The navigators suggest what to type. Naturally, the driver can opt not to type something if they feel it is incorrect or they may have another idea. In that case, the pair discusses what to do and decides together. \n",
