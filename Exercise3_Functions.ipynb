    "Because _Think Python_ assumes we're running Python on our own computers–rather than the wonderful world of JupyterHub–not all of the examples will translate perfectly. Here are a few differences to note with the Jupyter environment. Instead of the `turtle` module, we'll install and use `ipyturtle`. Instead of the two-letter methods in Chapter 4 such as `fd()` and `lt()` for moving the turtle around the drawing canvas forward and left, `ipyturtle` uses the whole words as its function names: `forward()` and `left()`. `ipyturtle` does not have a `mainloop()`. Here are some example function calls you can use, assuming `t=Turtle()`...\n",
