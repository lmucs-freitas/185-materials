    "Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get 21 points without going over. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value; Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10, and an Ace is worth 11. A player is dealt two cards and then they can say \"hit\" to get another card in hopes of getting closer to a score of 21, or \"stand\" to pass on getting another card in hopes of avoiding going over 21. \n",

    "**3)** If the user entered valid card values, use more conditional statements to decide whether to \"hit\" or \"stand\" ‚Äì or maybe you want to \"split\" which means getting two more cards and trying to get two Blackjacks (21s). An example would be: if the two cards total is 21, definitely \"stand\" (maybe even `print(\"blackjack!!\")` for fun?), if the total is greater than 17 or so, also \"stand\", maybe \"split\" if the user was dealt two Aces, and otherwise \"hit\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** In this game, each player's cards are dealt one face down and the next face up. Edit your code so far to also ask the user for the value of the face-up card their opponent was dealt. Does this change our decision of whether to get another card or not? Discuss strategy and implementation with your group."
